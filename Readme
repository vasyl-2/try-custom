tsc src/app.ts  --experimentalDecorators "true" works. Without --experimentalDecorators "true" throws error:
 "error TS1219: Experimental support for decorators is a feature that is subject to change in a future release.
  Set the 'experimentalDecorators' option in your 'tsconfig' or 'jsconfig' to remove this warning"

experimentalDecorators=true in tsconfig.json. But anyway requires.
